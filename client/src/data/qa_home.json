    "aboutMe": "I am a Senior QA Engineer and SDET with over 11 years of experience ensuring that software isn’t just functional but reliable, secure, high-performing, and built to scale. \n\nThroughout my career, I’ve worked across UI, API, performance, security, and cloud testing, helping teams ship products with confidence and speed. I specialize in building robust, maintainable automation frameworks using tools like Selenium, Cypress, and UFT, and integrating them seamlessly into modern CI/CD pipelines.\n\nOver the years, I’ve driven multiple 0-to-1 initiatives, defined test strategies for complex systems, and led teams toward quality-first engineering practices. With a proven track record of automating 10,000+ test cases and significantly improving test coverage, I thrive on solving problems, optimizing processes, and elevating the overall quality bar. Whether it’s designing an end-to-end automation suite, strengthening security and performance validation, or mentoring teams, I’m passionate about delivering software that users can trust—every single time.",
